		<h1>HISTORY AND BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUITAR</h1>
		<h3>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings. It is typically played with both
			hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand,
			while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand.
			The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the
			guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker. </h3><br>
