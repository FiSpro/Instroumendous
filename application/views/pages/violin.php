		<h1>HISTORY AND BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE VIOLIN</h1>
		<h3>The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family.
			Most
			violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the
			family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3,
			D4,
			A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking
			the
			strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side
			of
			the bow (col legno).</h3><br>
