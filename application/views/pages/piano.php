		<h1>HISTORY AND BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PIANO</h1>
		<h3>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the
			year
			1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a
			softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is
			played
			using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the
			fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</h3><br>
